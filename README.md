PyDAGMC is a Python interface for interacting with DAGMC .h5m files through the embedded topological relationships and metadata contained within. These interactions occur through a set of Python classes corresponding to DAGMCâ€™s metadata Group (a grouping of volumes or surfaces), Volume, and Surface groupings in the mesh database. This interface is intended to provide a simple interface for obtaining information about DAGMC models, replacing significant boilerplate code required to perform the same queries with PyMOAB, the Python interface for MOAB itself.
